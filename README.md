# **Tanuki Photo Sharing - Share Your Moments with the World**

Are you a beginner photographer with a passion for capturing moments? Do you want to showcase your photography skills and get valuable feedback from a community of like-minded individuals? Then Tanuki Photo Sharing is the perfect app for you!

Tanuki Photo Sharing is a journey with me, as I combine my new hobby of really bad photography with my self-study rust ninja path. This app is designed to be a platform for sharing your final edited photos along with the original photo, allowing you to receive votes, recommendations, and advice from other users. You can even upload your own edited version of the photo for others to see.

This is a beginner photo sharing app, so don't expect art. However, we believe that everyone has their own unique perspective, and we're here to provide a supportive and inclusive environment for you to showcase your creativity.

With Tanuki Photo Sharing, you can browse photos labeled by emotions and themes, making it easy to find the content that interests you. You can also filter and search for photos based on your preferences, ensuring that you can always find the photos you want to see.

## **Key Features - Coming soon (hopefully)**

- Upload both edited and raw photos
- Rate photos and get valuable insight on your own photos
- Upload new edited photo versions and compare with others' versions

Join the Tanuki Photo Sharing community today and share your moments with the world!
